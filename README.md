# Password-Generator-Project-with-CLI-GUI-tests-.
PasswordPy is a Python-based secure password generator that helps users create strong and customizable passwords. The project includes both a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it easy for technical and non-technical users alike.
The generator uses Python’s secrets module to ensure cryptographically secure randomness and supports flexible options such as password length, inclusion of digits/symbols, and strong policy enforcement (at least one uppercase, lowercase, digit, and symbol).
